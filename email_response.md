### - **Why are you interested in Reedsy's mission?**

I feel genuinely aligned with Reedsy’s mission to empower authors and democratize publishing because my professional background is deeply rooted in supporting the delivery of meaningful, high-quality digital products—particularly in the EdTech and creative sectors. Having spent nearly a decade as the lead QA Engineer at Team Satchel, I’ve worked on web and mobile applications that aim to enrich users' experiences and make tools more accessible, much like Reedsy’s platform does for writers and publishers.

What resonates most with me is Reedsy’s dedication to creative empowerment and its fully remote, globally collaborative culture. I thrive in agile, cross-functional teams and have consistently contributed to building robust, user-focused platforms through meticulous testing practices and a shift-left approach. My experience in ensuring high standards for usability, responsiveness, and accessibility mirrors Reedsy’s user-first philosophy.


### - **What's your experience working remotely? (we're fully remote at Reedsy!)**

Worked fully remotely at Satchel post-covid, with occasional travel into the London office. Worked a 9am-5pm schedule, with flexible (additional) hours to support business needs as required. The development team was distributed, so alongside remote working I was also accustomed to working with colleagues in different time zones/countries and that was a unique experience. Everyone truly feels together, even when physically apart. I am proficient in using conferencing tools such as Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Slack!


### - **When would you be available to start?**

### - **What's your rate or current salary expectations?**

In the region of 38000-42000 GBP per annum
