# Quality Assurance

## 1. About you

During my time at Team Satchel, I played a key role as the lead QA Engineer, contributing to the development and maintenance of their suite of cloud-based MIS and wellbeing applications, used by educational institutions in the UK and US. My work focused on ensuring high-quality user experiences across both web and mobile platforms, using a mix of manual and automated testing approaches.

I created and maintained detailed test plans and test cases, performed rigorous regression testing, and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams in an Agile environment. I was responsible for end-to-end testing across Satchel's web and native iOS/Android apps, leveraging tools like Cypress, BrowserStack, TestRail, and Jira to ensure coverage and defect management. I also tested for UI/UX responsiveness, performance, and accessibility across multiple browsers and devices.

A notable achievement was implementing Cypress-based automation to significantly reduce manual testing time while increasing coverage and reliability. I also contributed to the release process by building internal release note practices and aligning closely with developers and designers through a “shift-left” approach to quality. I also utilised BDD approaches to ensure that would then go on to improve collaboration with other teams, and make test cases more approachable to non-technical stakeholders alongside it being living documentation of system behaviour.

This project allowed me to build a holistic understanding of the QA lifecycle within a fast-paced SaaS environment and refine my technical and communication skills to align with both business goals and user needs. In addition to web apps, I have also worked extensively with mobile app developers to ensure functionality consistency and a quality end user experience.


## 2. Manual testing

Once the app is up and running, please perform manual adhoc testing:

  - [ ] Write up any bugs you find, as if you're raising a ticket
  - [ ] Include repro steps
  - [ ] Test across multiple devices and browsers, and include this information where relevant
  - [ ] Even if they're not strictly bugs, flag any parts of the UI/UX that feel like they could be improved, and provide a possible suggestion

```

## 3. Automated testing

Please write some automated end-to-end tests for this app.

You **should**:

  - [ ] include simple instructions for running the tests, including installing any tools
  - [ ] write **failing** tests for the **two highest priority bugs**
  - [ ] explain why these are the highest priority bugs
  - [ ] write a **passing** test for a working feature
  - [ ] explain why this passing test is worthwhile
  - [ ] write robust, maintainable tests
  - [ ] should not rely on the test environment having stable data

You **may**:

  - [ ] use any automated testing tools you like
